# hibzz.console

The hibzz.console package is a tool and framework used to add an in-game console for games made in Unity. This package can be installed in the Unity Package Manager using the following git URL.

```
https://github.com/Hibzz-Games/com.hibzz.console.git
```

Once the package is installed, go to the hierarchy window and right-click to add a new gameobject under Custom > Hibzz.Console. Note that only one instance of the console can exist at a time and any added instances will be removed automatically when entering play mode. Just to be safe, press the ***"Scan for Commands"*** button from the unity inspector so that the console is up to date on all commands.

By default, the Slash button (`/`) is used as the prefix and to activate the console from the keyboard. This can be modified easily in the prefab. You may also change the default log color from here.
