# hibzz.console

The hibzz.console package is a tool and framework used to add an in-game console for games made in Unity. This package can be installed in the Unity Package Manager using the following git URL.

```
https://github.com/Hibzz-Games/com.hibzz.console.git
```

Once the package is installed, navigate to `Packages > hibzz.unity.console > Prefabs` and drag and drop the `DeveloperConsole` to the preferred scene. Note that there can be only one instance of the console and any instances added will be removed automatically when entering play mode. Just to be safe, press the ***"Scan for Commands"*** button from the unity inspector so that the console is up to date on all commands.

By default, the Slash button (`/`) is used as the prefix and to activate the console from the keyboard. This can be modified easily in the prefab. You may also change the default log color from here.
